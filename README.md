# GrantScope the Grant Analysis Dashboard

The GrantScope is a powerful tool designed to help grant analysts and writers explore and analyze grant data effectively. By leveraging the capabilities of this dashboard utility, users can gain valuable insights into funding opportunities, identify trends, and make informed decisions when writing grant proposals or seeking funding sources.

## Features

- **Data Summary**: Get a high-level overview of the grant data, including the total number of unique grants, funders, and recipients. Explore the top funders by total grant amount and the grant distribution by funder type.

- **Grant Amount Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of grant amounts across different USD clusters. Filter the data based on specific USD clusters, grant subjects, populations, and strategies to focus on areas of interest.

- **Grant Amount Scatter Plot**: Analyze the relationship between grant amounts and years through an interactive scatter plot. Select specific year ranges and USD clusters to identify patterns and trends over time.

- **Grant Amount Heatmap**: Gain insights into the distribution of grant amounts across different dimensions such as grant subjects, populations, and strategies. Customize the heatmap by selecting the desired dimensions and explore the underlying data for specific cells.

- **Grant Description Word Clouds**: Discover the most frequently used words in grant descriptions for different USD clusters. Word clouds provide a visual representation of key terms and themes, helping you identify common areas of focus within each cluster.

- **Treemaps by Subject, Population, and Strategy**: Visualize the hierarchical structure of grant amounts based on grant subjects, populations, and strategies. Treemaps allow you to quickly identify the most significant categories and drill down into specific areas for detailed analysis.

- **Univariate Analysis of Numeric Columns**: Perform univariate analysis on numeric columns to understand the distribution and characteristics of grant data. Explore histograms, boxplots, and summary statistics for selected numeric variables.

- **Top Categories by Unique Grant Count**: Identify the top categories within key categorical variables such as funder type, recipient organization, grant subject, population, strategy, and year. Analyze the percentage of total unique grants accounted for by the top categories and explore grants within selected categories.
